# Compression

Collection of notes on compression. Focusing on text compression, notes are in compression.md, and each folder is a different algorithm. Based on texts like https://mattmahoney.net/dc/dce.html and http://www.hutter1.net/ai/, as well as Wiki entries for each algorithm.

Big idea is that intelligence can be expressed as the ability to understand data, and optimal compression requires an understanding of data, so compression is an AI/ML problem.
